Compiling:
To compile this file, one must first navigate to the directory
tyarn-Paging-No-Swap from the command line. After one has navigated to
this directory, simply typemake to compile the program correctly. 

Running the program:
To run this program you must, after compiling, type the command ./Simulate Test1.lc_config
where where Test1.lc_config represents any file with the extension .lc_config, I
have included some .lc_config files to Test testcases with.
However to load any programs onto this simulated machine you must have appropriate
files to do so, I have included some of these files as Test cases to
test my machine.

What works In respect to the program Assignment:
In respect to the program Assignment, everything to my knowledge works
in accordance with the program assignment up to this point, where we
are not using swap area yet. To elaborate, the simulator correctly
performs LRU or FIFO paging techniques,depending on which is
specified, The program also correctly kills pages in the usedPages
queue that contain a PID of a process that is halting or being
killed. The program also correctly keeps track of the number of
timeslices and pagefaults for each PCB and prints them out when a
program has halted.It also correctly prints out the pages of the
program in the order that they are in in the queue and correctly
prints the things specified for the jobs command. It also correctly
will error out if memory is full of dirty pages and it cant load
anymore in to memory.

The testcases that are used to test that each thing is working in my
program is held tyarn-paging-testcases/TestCases.txt
